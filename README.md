This bot was made with discord.py.
The aim is to plan events and set reminder more easily.

## Usage

### Remind / Rappel

They are multiple syntax that you can use, and the bot will send you a private message when it is time.

The command also work with !rappel for the baguette O fromage

You will certainly need to setup your personnal time shift with this command.
`!settimezone +4`

(You also can set minus smth)
